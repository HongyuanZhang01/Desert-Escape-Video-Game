# Desert-Escape-Video-Game

This project was made for an 8th Grade Science Fair entry. It was awarded #1st Place Overall.
This project uses Python's public Library Pygame to power the movements and animations in the game.

You are stuck on an island. After struggling to survive, you successfully and resourcefully gathers some equipment, and finds the shore. The only thing standing between you and freedom is the infamous Dagon monster. You need to beat the dragon to make it safely to the shore, but with such a formidable foe, the chances of survival is small.

Hope you enjoy!
